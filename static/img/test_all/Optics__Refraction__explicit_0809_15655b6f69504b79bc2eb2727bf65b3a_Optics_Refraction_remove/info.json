  "edit_instruction": "Remove every transparent cylindrical glass vessel and the water inside them from the scene: the tall thin cylinder in the center-left, the medium-height cylinder right of center, and the two short tumblers at left and right. Delete their rims, glass thickness, meniscus lines, internal reflections, and base distortions. Eliminate all traces they created on the set\u2014cast shadows, bright caustic bands, and surface reflections\u2014so no glass-related artifacts remain. Reconstruct the area they covered with the correct scene content: a smooth, uniform beige tabletop/background and an unobstructed view of the papaya pieces. Replace all refracted imagery with the true, undistorted background: remove the inverted/magnified orange-and-black papaya images that appeared through the glass and water, and restore the papaya half as a continuous, naturally shaped section with aligned rind, flesh, and seed cavity where it was previously warped or hidden. Maintain the original camera perspective and lighting; keep only the papaya\u2019s own shadows on the beige surface. The final image should show just the papaya resting on the beige surface with no evidence that glass cups were ever present.",
